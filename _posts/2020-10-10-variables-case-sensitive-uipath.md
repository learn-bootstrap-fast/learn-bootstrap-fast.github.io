Question: Which of the following is true about case sensitive variable names in UiPath

- [ ] &nbsp;  UiPath method names are case sensitive
- [ ] &nbsp;  UiPath variable names are case sensitive
- [x] &nbsp;  UiPath method names are not case sensitive
- [x] &nbsp;  UiPath variable names are not case sensitive

## Answer

It is best to be consistent in how you name and reference methods and variables. But the truth of the matter is that UiPath is not case sensitive with regards to variable and method names.

Note that some have said variable names being passed in and out as arguments are case sensitive. Not sure if this is a bug or accepted behavior? Regardless, when you write code, be consistent and treat the program like it was case sensitive.
