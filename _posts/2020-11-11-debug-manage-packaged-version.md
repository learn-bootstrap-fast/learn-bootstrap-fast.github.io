<h1>UiPath Activities Package Version Number</h1>

Question: An error has occurred and you need to know which version of the UiPath.Excel.Activities library is installed. Where would you find this information?

- [ ] &nbsp;  In the Help --> About option from UiPath Studio's main menu
- [ ] &nbsp;  From the installation log files
- [ ] &nbsp;  Right click on any Excel activity and select Properties
- [x] &nbsp;  Locate the library in the Manage Packages window

## Answer

Options d is correct.

The Manage Packes window allows you to add, remove, install and update packages, and part of updating a package is knowing which version is currently installed. If you locate an installed library in the package manager, it will tell you the version number.
