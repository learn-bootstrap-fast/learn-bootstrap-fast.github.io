Question: Which of the following would be an example of a camel case naming convention?

- [x]   uipathNamingConventions
- [ ]   UiPath-Naming-Conventions
- [ ]   UIPATH_NAMING_CONVENTIONS
- [x]   UiPathNamingConventions

## Answer

According to the [UiPath docs](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/docs/naming-rules):

> The camel case convention specifies that each word in the middle of the variable name begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation.

As a result, uipathNamingConventions and UiPathNamingConventions comply with the camel case naming convention.

#### UiPath and Camel Case

UiPath variables should comply with the camel case naming convention.
