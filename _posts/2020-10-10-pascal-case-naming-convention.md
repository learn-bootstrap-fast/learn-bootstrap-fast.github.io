Question: Which of the following is an example of the Pascal case naming convention?

- [ ] &nbsp;  Pascal-Case
- [ ] &nbsp;  pascalCase
- [x] &nbsp;  PascalCase
- [ ] &nbsp;  Pascal_case

## Answer

The correct answer is PascalCase. Also known as 'upper camel case,' Pascal case does not use spaces or underscores, and capitalizes the first letter of each new word, including the first word in the variable name.

Pascal case is mentioned on all of the UiPath variable naming documentation, along with snake case, camel case and [kebab-case](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Why-you-should-make-kebab-case-a-URL-naming-convention-best-practice), so at the very least be familiar with these terms.

There's more [details](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/v2019/docs/st-nmg-002) about variable naming strategies on the UiPath site.
