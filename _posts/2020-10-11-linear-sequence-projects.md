Question: Which type of project is best for linear activities involving multiple activities such as OCR and PDF data extraction?

- [x] &nbsp;  Sequence
- [ ] &nbsp;  Flow Chart
- [ ] &nbsp;  State Machine
- [ ] &nbsp;  Global Exception Handler

## Answer

The key to this question is the term 'linear.' The activities involved don't matter. So long as the robotic process to be automated is primarily linear, the right type of project to use is a sequence project.

> Sequences projects tend to be the smallest in complexity. They are well suited to linear processes as they allow you to move sequentially from one UiPath activity to the next.

Look in the the UiPath docs for more [detail](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/v2019/docs/sequences).
