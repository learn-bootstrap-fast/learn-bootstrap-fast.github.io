<h1>UiPath variable debugging</h1>

Question: Which of the following statements are true about UiPath variable debugging?

- [ ] &nbsp;  It is possible to edit String variables at runtime using the debugger
- [ ] &nbsp;  It is possible to edit String and int values at runtime using the debugger
- [x] &nbsp;  It is possible to edit any variable at runtime using the debugger
- [ ] &nbsp;  It is not possible to edit variables at runtime after the program has started

## Answer

Options c is correct.

The UiPath Studio Locals panel, which only shows during debugging activities, alows you to inspect variables and subsequently change them at runtime while the program has been paused by a breakpoint.
