Question: Which type of project is most likely to be used and reused in other projects?

- [x] &nbsp;  Sequence
- [ ] &nbsp;  Flow Chart
- [ ] &nbsp;  State Machine
- [ ] &nbsp;  Global Exception Handler

## Answer

Sequence projects are intended to be small, reusable pieces of logic that can be used in other sequence projects, flow chart projects and state machine projects.

> One of the key attributes of UiPath sequence projects is that they can be reused in standalone RPA systems or as part of a flow chart or state machine project.

See the the UiPath documentaiton for more [detail](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/v2019/docs/sequences).
