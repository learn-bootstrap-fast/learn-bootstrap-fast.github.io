<h1>UiPath Studio Locals Panel for Debugging</h1>
Question: Which UiPath Studio screen only appears while you are actively debugging a program?

- [ ] &nbsp;  Log panel
- [x] &nbsp;  Locals panel
- [ ] &nbsp;  Breakpoints panel
- [ ] &nbsp;  Output panel

## Answer

Options b is correct answer to this UiPath Certification question.

When you debug a program and a breakpoint is encountered, the Locals panel appears allowing a UiPath developer to look deeper at:
- A description of the type of UiPath Exceptions thrown
- Arguments passed in
- Variables used in the program
- Properties of the current activity and the previously executed activity (input and output)
