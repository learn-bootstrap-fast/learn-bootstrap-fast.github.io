blurb: Here's how Jakarta Servlets compare versus other Java and non-Java technologies like CGI, PHP, JSPs etc.
---

In functionality, Jakarta servlets provide a higher level abstraction than Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
programs but a lower level of abstraction than that provided by web frameworks such as Jakarta
Server Faces (JSF). JSF and Servlets are very similar.

<h2>Java Servlets vs CGI</h2>

Compared to JSF, JSPs, CGI and PHP, Jakarta Servlets have the following advantages:

- They are generally much faster than CGI scripts because a different process model is used

- They use a standard API that is supported by many web servers

- They have all the advantages of the Java programming language, including ease of development
and platform independence

- They can access the large set of APIs available for the Java platform
