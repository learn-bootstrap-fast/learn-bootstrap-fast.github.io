Question: A task to be automated has multiple decision points with unique UiPath activities to be performed based on the outcome of various conditions. What type of project should be used in this situation?

- [ ] &nbsp;  Sequence
- [x] &nbsp;  Flow Chart
- [ ] &nbsp;  State Machine
- [ ] &nbsp;  This is not an automatable task

## Answer

This question is pretty much the definitoin of a UiPath Flowchart project.

Yes, you can do conditional logic in a sequence project. But multiple branch points with complex operations is what a flowchart is all about. 

> The most important aspect of flowcharts is that, unlike sequences, they present multiple branching logical operators, that enable you to create complex business processes and connect activities in multiple ways.

See the the UiPath documentaiton for more [detail](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/v2019/docs/flowcharts).
