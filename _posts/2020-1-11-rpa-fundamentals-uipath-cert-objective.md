### Partial Transcript of UiPath Tutorial

Here's a partial transcript I put together from the start of Cameron's tutorial:

> Hey, I'm Cameron McKenzie,  @cameronmcnz on twitter and I wanted to just give you a basic overview of some of the technologies you need to know if you want to tackle the UiPath Associate Exam. 

> Now my buddy Serge is running a site called upath.rpacertified.com with lots of great stuff. There's a bunch of practice tests and there's even a UiPath study guidem but one of the links up here is the exam objectives and if you want to pass this exam you need to go over these objectives and gain confidence in each on if you want to pass the UiPath Associate exam. 

> ## Pass the UiPath Certification Exam

>  You'll notice one of the objectives is RPA Fundamentals. You end up getting three or four questions on this particular topic so knowing this can be the difference between passing and failing the exam.  

>  Functionality of products like studio robots and orchestrator are key, so what I want to do in this video is take you through these different products show you what you need to know about these tools, and talk about the depth of the UiPath Associate Exam on these subjects. 

>  I'll show you how to create things in studio, how to create a process in orchestrator and how to configure robots to run on remote desktop machines. That's the focus of this UiPath YouTube tutorial. If you're competent with these functions you're going to pass the UiPath Certification Exam.
