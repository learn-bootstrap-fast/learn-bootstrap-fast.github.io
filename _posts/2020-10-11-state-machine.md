Question: A UiPath `transition` activity is associated with which type of project? 

- [ ] &nbsp;  Sequence
- [ ] &nbsp;  Flow Chart
- [x] &nbsp;  State Machine
- [ ] &nbsp;  This is not an automatable task

## Answer

The answer here is State Machine.

The UiPath Associate exam won't quiz you heavily on the State Machine. But `State Machine` might be offered as an incorrect option on some questions just to throw you off, so at the very least be familiar with the concept. Don't waste your time studying it in depth though.
