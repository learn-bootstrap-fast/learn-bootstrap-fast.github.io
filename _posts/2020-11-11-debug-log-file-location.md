<h1>UiPath Studio Log File Location</h1>

Question: Where does UiPath Studio store log files by default?

- [ ] &nbsp;  %UiPathInstallRoot%\logs
- [ ] &nbsp;  %UserHome%\UiPath\logs
- [ ] &nbsp;  %UiPathInstallRoot%\bin\logs
- [x] &nbsp;  %localappdata%\UiPath\Logs

## Answer

Options d is correct.

This question is given a difficult score of 9 and would likely fall outside of the objectives for the Associate exam, although it's fair game for the developer exam. 

Don't feel bad if you're studying for the Associate exam and got this wrong. But at the same time, you really need to know where UiPath log files are located.
