<h1>Uipath Git, GitHub, TFS and Subversion SVN</h1>

Question: What three DVCS tools are configurable during the UiPath Studio installation procedure?

- [ ] &nbsp;  Mercurial SCM
- [x] &nbsp;  Apache Subversion
- [x] &nbsp;  Microsoft Team Foundation Server
- [x] &nbsp;  Git

## Answer

Options b, c and d are correct.

Right off the bat, UiPath Studio version control support includes SVN, TFS and Git. 

Note that TFS has been rebranded Azure DevOps Server. A future relase of the tool, and the UiPath Associate Certification Exam, will likely reflect that change.
