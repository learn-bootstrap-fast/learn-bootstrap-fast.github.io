Question: The variable `UIPATH_ASSOCIATE_EXAM` is said to follow what naming convention ?

- [ ] &nbsp;  camel case
- [ ] &nbsp;  snake case
- [x] &nbsp;  screaming snake case
- [ ] &nbsp;  kebab case

## Answer

The UiPath varaiable `UIPATH_ASSOCIATE_EXAM` is said to be written in screaming snake case. This makes C the most correct answer to this question.

#### UiPath screaming snake case

The use of the underscore to separate words in a UiPath variable is called snake case, so option B is somewhat correct. But when all the letters are uppercase, the naming convention is known as `screaming snake case` so C is the most correct answer of the bunch.

Screaming snake case violates the UiPath RegEx rule `([A-Z]|[a-z])+([A-Z]|[a-z]|[0-9])` and as such it is not considered a valid variable name and will be flagged by the UiPath Anaylze File process.

Screaming snake case is commonly used for constants. In Java, all [static final constants](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Why-we-use-static-final-in-Java-for-constants) are written in screaming snake case.
