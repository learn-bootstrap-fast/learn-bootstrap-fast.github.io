I"<p>A servlet is a Jakarta technology-based web component, managed by a container, that generates dynamic content.</p>

<h2>What is a Jakarta Servlet in Java?</h2>

<p>Like other Jakarta technology-based components, servlets are platform-independent Java classes that are compiled to platform-neutral byte code that can be loaded dynamically into and run by a Jakarta technology-enabled web server. Containers, sometimes called servlet engines, are web server extensions that provide servlet functionality. Servlets interact with web clients via a request response paradigm implemented by the servlet container.</p>

<p>In short, a Jakarta Servlet in a Java based web component designed to handle the HTTP based request-response cycle.</p>

<h3>How a Jakarta Servlet works</h3>

<p>The way a Java Jakarta Servlet works is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a web based request comes into the Java web server</li>
  <li>the request is passed to a Java Servlet</li>
  <li>a method such as doGet or doPost is called depending on how the HttpServlet was invoked</li>
  <li>a developer inspects the request, extracts parameters passed the the client</li>
  <li>backend resources are accessed to fullfill the incoming request</li>
  <li>a response, normally HTML or JSON, packaged in the HttpServletResponse object, is delivered back to the client</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jakarta Servlets and the Java Servlet Container</h3>

<p>Jakarta Servlets require a Java runtime to operate. The environment in which they are run and managed is known as a Java Sevlet Container</p>
