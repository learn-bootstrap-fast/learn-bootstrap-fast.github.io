I"L<p>In functionality, Jakarta servlets provide a higher level abstraction than Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
programs but a lower level of abstraction than that provided by web frameworks such as Jakarta
Server Faces (JSF). JSF and Servlets are very similar.</p>

<h2>Java Servlets vs CGI</h2>

<p>Compared to JSF, JSPs, CGI and PHP, Jakarta Servlets have the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are generally much faster than CGI scripts because a different process model is used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They use a standard API that is supported by many web servers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have all the advantages of the Java programming language, including ease of development
and platform independence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can access the large set of APIs available for the Java platform</p>
  </li>
</ul>
