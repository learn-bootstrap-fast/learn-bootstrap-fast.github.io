I"£<p>After a servlet is properly initialized, the servlet container may use it to handle client requests.</p>

<p>Requests are represented by request objects of type ServletRequest. The servlet fills out responses to
requests by calling methods of a provided object of type ServletResponse.</p>

<h2>Request handling in Java Servlets</h2>

<p>These objects are passed as
parameters to the service method of the Servlet interface.
In the case of an HTTP request, the objects provided by the container are of types HttpServletRequest
and HttpServletResponse.
Note that a servlet instance placed into service by a servlet container may handle no requests during
its lifetime.</p>
