Create a Bootstrap 5 section called "How to Get Started" for an AWS exam prep website.

- Center the section title and use a bold H2 that says “How to Get Started”.
- Add a short motivational paragraph below the heading encouraging users to begin their AWS certification journey.

Use a 3-column layout below the intro, each showing a step in the process:
- Each step should have:
  - A round white icon bubble with a soft shadow.
  - A  circular badge in the top-right with the step number (01, 02, 03).
  - The icon itself should use the same gradient as the site’s hero section.
  - Add a short bold heading for the step name.
  - Add a sentence below describing the step.

Use the following three steps for the heading and sentence below:
1. **Select an Exam** – “We have over 20 AWS exams to choose from.”
2. **Answer Each Question** – “We'll let you know if you got the answer right or wrong.”
3. **Track Your Progress** – “We'll keep track of which questions you got right and wrong and where you need to focus your study.”

Add subtle `fadeInUp` animations with optional delays for each column. Use existing font styles and global color variables.

Create a responsive Bootstrap 5 HTML section with a full-width gradient background (use existing site gradient).

The section should contain 4 animated statistic counters, arranged in a grid layout (2 per row on small screens, 4 in a row on large screens).

Each counter box should include:

A square icon box with a white background and a centered LineIcons (LNI) or Font Awesome icon.
A large bold number (e.g., 1200+) that animates by counting up from zero when it enters the viewport.
A smaller label below (e.g., "Certifications").
Use these data points:

1200+ Certifications
20+ AWS Exams
5000+ Exam Questions
100+ Contributing Experts
Style:

Use the same gradient for the background as the one used in the hero section.
Use countUp.js or a simple intersection observer + JS to trigger the number animation on scroll.
Add hover or fadeInUp animations with optional WOW.js.

Create a new Bootstrap 5 HTML section named pricing.

The background should be the same gradient used in the hero section. Where the background is dark, use light fonts.


The title for this section is “Help Support the Site!”.

Below that, add:
- A short paragraph that says: “We want to remain the number 1 destination for AWS certification help and guidance on the internet. You can help support the site in the following ways.”

Then create a responsive 4-column pricing-style card layout, where each card is equal height and width. The cards should have a light-grey background and dark text.

The title on each card should be the price, which is displayed in large font and the text should use the same gradient as the hero background.

Here's how the four cards should be laid out, including the image displayed in the body. The images are all 585x756 in size but should be displayed in a responsive manner that fits the card nicely.

I'd like to completely redo the support-section. Recreate that section using the following prompt:

Create a new Bootstrap 5 HTML section named pricing.

The background should be the same gradient used in the hero section. Where the background is dark, use light fonts.

The title for this section is “Help Support the Site!”.
